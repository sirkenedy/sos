                            Osun State School of Science, Ondo road, Ile-Ife, is one of the first three Schools of Science established by the Old Oyo state Government in March 1990.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The School occupies the site of the defunct Oyo state College of Arts and Science situated along Ondo Road on the ancient city of Ile-Ife in Ife-Ijesa Zone of the state. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The school is a co-educational institution that runs a senior education programme only with the primary objective of training Nigerian and foreign students to be responsible and good citizens and to provide adequate and qualitative education for all and sundry at the secondary level. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Another basic aim is to prepare the students comprehensively in science education only in order to activate them towards inclined knowledge in science and technology. With this, our students would have an ambition to be scientifically viable and excel in their different science-oriented disciplines.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The school also prepares the students for future self-reliance, in order to have a positive purpose, direction and bearing towards a successful self-education after undergoing an all-round development.

                            Over the years, we have hosted various high ranking and important dignitaries like our royal father, Ooni of Ife, HRM Oba Okunade Sijuwade, Olubuse II, who visited the school during the era of OSCAS, and personalities like Navy Commander Anthony Idofia, one of the then Military Administrators of Osun State and many Commissioners, Permanent Secretaries, Honorable Members of Federal House of Assembly and State House Assembly. Equally many indigene Ambassadors and honorable Senate members have always given recognition to the School. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Over the years, old students both far and near and some indigenes in diaspora constantly visit the school from time to time to advise on positive progress and standardized administration.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The pioneering principal Mr. M.A. Akano and his crew did a remarkable and tireless job to standardize the school to this level. And over the years the assistants of Mrs. G.Y. Odetola, Mrs. P.E. Ajayi and host of others have been instrumental in putting down a solid administrative legacy.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The schools meaningful efforts, ambitions and administrative perfections are the recipes that have made its students and staffs to achieve continuous and regular excellent academic success. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Our continuous joy is that our yearly finalists secure admissions into various tertiary institutions of choice, and they are always identified for their brilliant performances in their different chosen careers and discipline both home and abroad.
